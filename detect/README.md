## TalkNet in TalkSet and Columbia ASD dataset

#### Data preparation

We find that it is challenge to apply the model we trained in AVA for the videos not in AVA (Reason is [here](https://github.com/TaoRuijie/TalkNet_ASD/blob/main/FAQ.md), Q3.1). So we build TalkSet, an active speaker detection dataset in the wild, based on `VoxCeleb2` and `LRS3`.

We do not plan to upload this dataset since we just modify it, instead of building it. In `TalkSet` folder we provide these `.txt` files to describe which files we used to generate the TalkSet and their ASD labels. You can generate this `TalkSet` if you are interested to train an ASD model in the wild.

Also, we have provided our pretrained TalkNet model in TalkSet. You can evaluate it in Columbia ASD dataset or other raw videos in the wild.
